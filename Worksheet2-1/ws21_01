- tree calculations: 
	1. height
	2. count (size)
	3. inorder preorder postorder (position of node root)

- tree of height:	1 can only have 1 nodes;
			2 can have 3 nodes;
			'h' can have 2^h-1 = (2^h)-1 ~ 2^h
- max no of nodes: N ~ 2^h   ->    h~ log2N
- binary search tree methods:
	- search:
		- L < a, R > a
		- L & R are also search trees
		- bool search (int x, Tree T):

public boolean search(int x, Tree T){
	if(T.isEmpty){
}
}
